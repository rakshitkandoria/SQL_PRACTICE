SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. This README provides an overview of essential SQL concepts, commands, and best practices.

## üîßSQL Basics

1. Tables: Data is organized in rows and columns.

2. Columns: Define the structure of the table (e.g., id, name, salary).

3. Rows: Represent individual records in a table.

4. Primary Key: A unique identifier for each record.

5. Foreign Key: Establishes relationships between tables.
